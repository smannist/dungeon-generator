## Weekly report 1

This weeks' focus was on reading the course instructions, choosing the topic and doing research on it. Choosing the topic was easy for me since I am a fan of roguelikes and the idea of procedural generation. Through my research, I have learned a lot about how procedural dungeon generation works, such as how and where to store data about rooms and how using different algorithms can lead to completely unique maps. However, I am not yet familiar with the technical side of these algorithms and I will need to spend more time learning about them (and if the instructors reading this document have good examples of A\* and random walk, I will gladly accept those!) Lastly, I have not yet begun working on the application itself, but I plan to start next week by working on the general architecture and classes.
