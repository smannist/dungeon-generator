# Weekly report 2

## What have I done this week?

I set up Poetry, Pylint and Pytest for the project. I added bases for the UI, BSPTree and dungeon generation classes. Also, a lot of time went on simple researching the topic.

## What have I learned?

I am starting to understand how BSP Tree works, but I am still uncertain about the correctness of my implementation. I have learned the basics of pygame, but there is still much to learn.

## Problems

I have a lot of questions:

- Currently the splitting of nodes in BSP Tree is done by comparing the x-coordinates of the given nodes. Would this cause problems in placing the rooms around the actual dungeon map or is this approach fine?
- Is the BSPNode class missing any required fields? I am not completely sure what information should be stored.
- I am not sure how to test the BSP Tree since the creation is randomized. Any tips?

## What will I do next?

Work on dungeon generation class (if needed, modify BSPTree accordingly) and start working on the UI.

## Conclusion

I have made progress, but there is still much work to be done. I will need to conduct further research and make changes to the classes if necessary. Luckily there is still plenty of time left.

Time used: ~8 hours
