# Weekly report 3

I had a brain blast this morning, and I think that my current approach is completely wrong. The root of the BSP Tree should be the size of the whole map, and
from there, I should divide the map into smaller sections (within the bounds). At least my current data structures are not completely wrong. I am fairly sure that the information held by nodes is enough. I can use the split nodes (or areas, planes) to hold a room, as long as the room size is within the bounds of the area. Now that I have a better grasp of what I am doing, things should go more smoothly this week. Changing the recursion of BSP Tree will be the first thing on the list (I will work extra time this week to make sure everything works).
