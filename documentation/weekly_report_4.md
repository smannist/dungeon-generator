# Weekly report 4

8.2.2023

I spoke with instructor earlier this week and decided to ditch the previous way of generating dungeon paths. The
dungeons look a bit better and more logical right now, which I am happy about. The next focus will be on writing more tests
and the random walk algorithm for generating biome -like areas.

Here is an image of generated example dungeon:
