# Weekly report 4

8.2.2023

I spoke with instructor earlier this week and decided to ditch the previous way of generating dungeon paths. The
dungeons look a bit better and more logical right now, which I am happy about. The next focus will be on writing more tests
and the random walk algorithm for generating biome -like areas.

Here is an image of generated example dungeon:

Random walk works now. Here is an example cave (biome) structure:

## What have I done this week?

Fixed pathway generation for dungeons. Created classes for random walk and biome generator. Wrote tests for random walk and biome generator. Especially
random walk is well tested. Worked on the UI a little bit.

## What have I learned?

I learned how to implement and use random walk to generate biome-like maps. I now have a better grasp of pygame.

## Problems

I have pretty much solved all my previous problems, so I have no questions this time.

## What will I do next?

I will start implementing features to showcase the dungeon/biome generation a
little bit i.e adding parameters to change the room size. UI needs to be improved. There is a little bit repetition in the UI
class as well so I will try to refactor it a little bit. Also more testing (including performance testing!)

## Conclusion

The project is progressing well!

Time used: ~9 hours I did not put as much work into the project as last week
