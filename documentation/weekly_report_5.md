## What have I done this week?

Wrote a few unit tests as well as performance tests. I also wrote the peer-review.

## What have I learned?

Nothing new this week.

## Problems

I need to take a better look at dungeon generation time complexity + analyze the performance graph (maybe edit it). Dungeon randomization makes analysing the
graph a little bit tricky.

## What will I do next?

Plenty of things to do:
Performance testing for generate dungeon and biome, better UI, parameters for dungeon/biome generation and finish implementation document.

## Conclusion

I was a little bit lazy this week, so if I want the app to look somewhat nice next week I will have to work another 20-30 hours.

Time used: ~4 hours on peer-review and ~4 hours on the project around 8 hours overall.
